<h3><p align="justify">The stunning park, named after Gran Paradiso mountain, is found in the northwestern part of Italy in the Alps. Besides striking landscape, valleys, mountain lakes, glaciers and alpine meadows, various endangered species, like Alpine Ibex, chamois, eagle-owl and more, find a home here. There are various small villages scattered in the park, where tourists can find visitor centers and learn more about the reserve.
<br><br>Why tourists go there?<br><br>
Obviously many people come here to have a good hike and admire the incredible views, that open from the mountains. Also animal and bird watching are among common activities – however the wildlife is so rich here, that one doesn’t need extra efforts to spot some local inhabitants here.
