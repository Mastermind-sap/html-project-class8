<h3><p align="justify">The second highest pass in the Alps promises one of the best scenic rides ever. The road connects Stelvio in South Tyrol with Bormio. The pass originally was built by the Austrian Empire in 1820’s and hadn’t changed much since. Stelvio is a traditional Tyrolian region, where one can find Alpine villages – picturesque, recluse and quiet, surrounded with mountains and skiing resorts.
<br><br>Why tourists go there?<br><br>
The historic road is one of the most famous passes in the Alps. It certainly provides great views and a classic winding route in the mountains, loved by the extreme drivers. The British show “Top Gear” called it the greatest driving road in the world!
