<h3><p align="justify">The scenic route stretches in the Emmental Alps as the steam locomotive slowly ascents to the Brienzer Rothorn mountain. The summit station is located at impressive 2244 m (7362 ft) height! The train also passes tunnels carved in the rock and makes breathtaking loops. Those who feel nervous about the heights – challenge themselves!
<br><br>
Why tourists go there?
<br><br>
It takes about an hour to reach the summit, where restaurants and guest houses pay a warm welcome to everyone. They also admire the views while hiking: there is a trail that stretches between the stations.
