<h3><p align="justify">The Alps present a great variety of elevations and shapes, ranging from the folded sediments forming the low-lying pre-Alps that border the main range everywhere except in northwestern Italy to the crystalline massifs of the inner Alps that include the Belledonne and Mont Blanc in France, the Aare and Gotthard in Switzerland, and the Tauern in Austria. From the Mediterranean to Vienna, the Alps are divided into Western, Central, and Eastern segments, each of which consists of several distinct ranges.
<br><br>The Western Alps trend north from the coast through southeastern France and northwestern Italy to Lake Geneva and the Rhône valley in Switzerland. Their forms include the low-lying arid limestones of the Maritime Alps near the Mediterranean, the deep cleft of the Verdon Canyon in France, the crystalline peaks of the Mercantour Massif, and the glacier-covered dome of Mont Blanc, which at 15,771 feet (4,807 metres) is the highest peak in the Alps. Rivers from these ranges flow west into the Rhône and east into the Po.
<br><br>The Central Alps occupy an area from the Great St. Bernard Pass east of Mont Blanc on the Swiss-Italian border to the region of the Splügen Pass north of Lake Como. Within this territory are such distinctive peaks as the Dufourspitze, Weisshorn, Matterhorn, and Finsteraarhorn, all 14,000 feet high. In addition, the great glacial lakes—Como and Maggiore in the south, part of the drainage system of the Po; and Thun, Brienz, and Lucerne (Vierwaldstättersee) in the north—fall within this zone.
<br><br>The Eastern Alps, consisting in part of the Rätische range in Switzerland, the Dolomite Alps in Italy, the Bavarian Alps of southern Germany and western Austria, the Tauern Mountains in Austria, the Julian Alps in northeastern Italy and northern Slovenia, and the Dinaric Alps along the western edge of the Balkan Peninsula, generally have a northerly and southeasterly drainage pattern. The Inn, Lech, and Isar rivers in Germany and the Salzach and Enns in Austria flow into the Danube north of the Alps, while the Mur and Drau (Austria) and Sava (Balkan region) rivers discharge into the Danube east and southeast of the Alps. Within the Eastern Alps in Italy, Lake Garda drains into the Po, whereas the Adige, Piave, Tagliamento, and Isonzo pour into the Gulf of Venice.
<br><br>Differences in relief within the Alps are considerable. The highest mountains, composed of autochthonous crystalline rocks, are found in the west in the Mont Blanc massif and also in the massif centring on Finsteraarhorn (14,022 feet) that divides the cantons of Valais and Bern. Other high chains include the crystalline rocks of the Mount Blanche nappe—which includes the Weisshorn (14,780 feet)—and the nappe of Monte Rosa Massif, sections of which mark the frontier between Switzerland and Italy. Farther to the east, Bernina Peak is the last of the giants over 13,120 feet (4,000 metres). In Austria the highest peak, the Grossglockner, reaches only 12,460 feet; Germany’s highest point, the Zugspitze in the Bavarian Alps, only 9,718 feet; and the highest point of Slovenia and the Julian Alps, Triglav, only 9,396 feet. Some of the lowest areas within the Western Alps are found at the delta of the Rhône River where the river enters Lake Geneva, 1,220 feet. In the valleys of the Eastern Alps north of Venice, elevations of only about 300 feet are common.
